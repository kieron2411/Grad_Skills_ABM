# Grad_Skills_ABM
Agent based model for simulating the spread of disease through a population for Coursework 1 of Applications of Mathematics and Graduate Skills.

Please note, you need to install the Python module Mesa to be able to run this code.

I apologise for the horrific over-commenting present in this code! I have a bad habit of doing that because I like understanding *exactly* what's going on in each line of the code. 

TO DO:
- Have the agents move around the grid
- Add more types of agents to complexify the model
